## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Optimal Settings
- **Skin Details**: High values may override shot settings - reduce if needed
- **Eye Details**: Balance with shot type to avoid conflicts
- **Negative Prompts**: Add `(closeup, close up, close-up:1.5)` if detail parameters interfere
- **Model Selection**: Use high-quality checkpoints for best results

### Recommended Models
- **[FormulaXL 2.0](https://civitai.com/models/129922?modelVersionId=160525)** - Excellent for photorealistic portraits
- **SDXL Models** - Generally provide superior portrait quality
- **Flux Models** - Use with Prompt Styler for optimal results

### Workflow Integration
- **Compatible with [Prompt Composer](https://github.com/florestefano1975/comfyui-prompt-composer/)**
- **Chain multiple Portrait Master nodes** for complex character creation
- **Use presets** to maintain consistency across projects

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Node not appearing in ComfyUI**
- Ensure ComfyUI is restarted after installation
- Check that files are in the correct `custom_nodes` directory
- Verify no Python errors in the console

**Random options not working**
- Connect a seed input to enable randomization
- Ensure "random üé≤" is selected in dropdown menus
- Check that the seed is properly connected

**Preset system not working**
- Verify write permissions in the ComfyUI directory
- Check that the `presets` folder is created automatically
- Ensure preset names don't contain invalid characters

**Nationality mixing not working**
- Install [ComfyUI Prompt Control](https://github.com/asagi4/comfyui-prompt-control) for full syntax support
- Use the format: `[nationality_1:nationality_2:mix_value]`
- This feature is experimental and may not work with all models

**Output prompts too complex**
- Use the Prompt Styler node to simplify for modern models
- Reduce weight values for subtle effects
- Set unused parameters to "-" to exclude them

### Performance Issues
- **Large workflows**: Consider using fewer nodes simultaneously
- **Memory usage**: High detail settings may increase VRAM requirements
- **Generation speed**: Complex prompts may slow down inference
